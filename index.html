          <p>The Heal Your Headache (HYH) Diet was created by Dr. David Bulchholz and published in the book by the same name. The book includes the most common Migraine trigger foods reported by Dr. Bulchholz’s patients. People with frequent migraine attacks, both classic and vestibular, might benefit from adopting this diet for at least four months or until migraine decreases significantly. We call this baseline. Once you have reached your baseline with Migraine, you can then attempt to <a href="https://www.migrainestrong.com/how-to-recognize-migraine-baseline-and-reintroduce-foods-after-an-elimination-diet/">reintroduce foods individually to identify your own food triggers.</a>  Below, there is an Ingredient Checker created by our admin team from Migraine Strong. Hopefully, this will allow you to feel more comfortable when selecting foods to order online or pick up from the store.</p>

                <p>This contains tea. Black, white and green tea are all triggers and should be eliminated. Chamomile, peppermint and other so-called "teas" are safe as long as they don't contain other known triggers.</p>

                <p>Soy products, especially if cultured (miso), fermented (tempeh) or otherwise highly processed (e.g., soy protein isolate/concentrate) are not allowed.  Also avoid soy sauce (as it is high in glutamate).  Soy oil, soy lecithin, and unprocessed soy like edamame are allowed.</p>

                <h3>Yeast:</h3>
                <p>Fresh yeast is high in tyramine and glutamate. Avoid fresh yeast-risen baked products homemade or commercial breads. Especially sourdough, bagels, doughnuts, pizza dough, soft pretzels, and some coffee cakes made with yeast. Once 24 hours have passed since baking, then it is allowed.</p>

                <p>Cheeses cured for less than 90 days are allowed. Aged cheeses, for more than 90 days, are not allowed in the HYH diet.

          <p class="disclaimer">*Even though these foods allowed based on the HYH Diet, everyone has different triggers. Something that may be considered safe for the majority of people, may be a personal trigger for you. </p>
