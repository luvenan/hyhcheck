          <p>The Heal Your Headache (HYH) Diet was created by Dr. David Bulchholz and published in the book by the same name. The book includes the most common Migraine trigger foods reported by Dr. Bulchholzâ€™s patients. <span id="extra-info-hyh">People with frequent migraine attacks, both classic and vestibular, might benefit from adopting this diet for at least four months or until migraine decreases significantly. We call this baseline. Once you have reached your baseline with Migraine, you can then attempt to <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.migrainestrong.com/how-to-recognize-migraine-baseline-and-reintroduce-foods-after-an-elimination-diet/">reintroduce foods individually to identify your own food triggers.</a> </span> Below, there is an Ingredient Checker created by our admin team from Migraine Strong. Hopefully, this will allow you to feel more comfortable when selecting foods to order online or pick up from the store.</p>
