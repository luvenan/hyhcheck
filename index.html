    <main>
      <p>The Heal Your Headache Diet was created by Dr. David Buchholz and published in the book by the same name. It includes the most common migraine trigger foods reported by his patients. People with frequent migraine attacks might benefit from adopting this diet for at least four months - or until migraines decrease signficantly - and then attempt to reintroduce foods individually to identify their own food triggers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This website was created to make it easier to determine if a particular food is or is not compliant with the hyh diet. Simply type or paste the ingredients in the box below, and click on the buttom "is it safe?" </p>
      <br>
     <!--  <p> This is a prototype, the only triggers currently programmed are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>General triggers: caffeine, lemon, parmesan;</li> 
          <li>MSG: gelatin, hydrolyzed, natural flavoring;</li>
          <li>Iffy ingredients: carob, citric acid, coconut;</li>
        </ul>
