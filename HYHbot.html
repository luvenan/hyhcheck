      <h2>The Heal Your Headache Diet was created by Dr. (?) and published in the book by the same name. It includes the most common migraine trigger foods reported by his patients. People with frequent migraine attacks might benefit from adopting this diet for at least four months - or until migraines decrease signficantly - and then attempt to reintroduce foods individually to identify their own food triggers. You can read more about it here, and here. I created this website to make it easier to determine if a particular food is or is not compliant with the hyh diet. Simply type or paste the ingredients in the box below, and click on the buttom "is it safe?" </h2>
